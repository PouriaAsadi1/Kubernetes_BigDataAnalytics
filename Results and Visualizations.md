# Taxi Dataset Analysis:

- Daily Trip Volume
  Objective
  We aimed to measure how the number of taxi trips varied by day during early January 2013 to understand general activity patterns in New York City.
  
  Findings
  The results show a steady flow of trips between 390,000 and 480,000 per day from January 1 to January 10. This indicates consistent demand for taxi transportation across weekdays and weekends, with slightly higher activity   during the first weekend of the month.

- Payment Type Distribution
  Objective
  We sought to understand how passengers paid for their rides and the relative frequency of each payment method.
  
  Findings
  Credit card and cash payments dominated the data, accounting for the vast majority of trips. Credit card transactions slightly outnumbered cash ones, suggesting a growing reliance on electronic payments. A small fraction     of trips used other categories such as corporate or discount accounts.

- Hourly Trip Distribution
  Objective
  We wanted to examine when taxi trips were most frequent during a typical day to identify demand peaks.
  
  Findings
  Trip volume was highest around midnight and during the morning commute hours from 7 to 9 a.m. This pattern suggests strong activity during nightlife periods and daily work commutes. Lower trip counts were observed in mid-    afternoon and early evening hours.

- Trip Distance Distribution
  Objective
  We measured how trip frequency changed with distance to understand travel behavior and demand concentration.
  
  Findings
  Short-distance trips under 3 miles were the most common, representing the majority of all rides. As trip distance increased, the number of trips decreased. Only a small portion of trips exceeded 10 miles, confirming that     most taxi usage occurs within short urban ranges.
