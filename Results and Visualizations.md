# Taxi Dataset Analysis:

- **Daily Trip Volume**

  Objective: 
  We aimed to measure how the number of taxi trips varied by day during early January 2013 to understand general activity patterns in New York City.

- Findings: 
  The dataset includes 365 daily records from January through December 2013. Trip counts ranged between roughly 390,000 and 480,000 per day, with consistent activity across the year. Days with higher totals tended to align     with weekends and holidays, reflecting increased leisure transportation.
  

- **Payment Type Distribution**

  Objective: 
  We sought to understand how passengers paid for their rides and the relative frequency of each payment method.

  Findings: 
  Credit card and cash payments dominated the data, accounting for the vast majority of trips. Credit card transactions slightly outnumbered cash ones, suggesting a growing reliance on electronic payments. A small fraction     of trips used other categories such as corporate or discount accounts.


- **Hourly Trip Distribution**

  Objective: 
  We wanted to examine when taxi trips were most frequent during a typical day to identify demand peaks.

  Findings:
  Trip volume was highest around midnight and during the morning commute hours from 7 to 9 a.m. This pattern suggests strong activity during nightlife periods and daily work commutes. Lower trip counts were observed in mid-    afternoon and early evening hours.


- **Trip Distance Distribution**

  Objective: 
  We measured how trip frequency changed with distance to understand travel behavior and demand concentration.

  Findings:
  Short-distance trips under 3 miles were the most common, representing the majority of all rides. As trip distance increased, the number of trips decreased. Only a small portion of trips exceeded 10 miles, confirming that     most taxi usage occurs within short urban ranges.
